## Inline Assembly in C

### HW1 - Bubble Sort in Array/ Merge Sort in Linked List
The goal is to integrate assembly instructions directly within C code to handle the sorting operations at a low level, providing more control over the underlying hardware.



### jump backward and forward 
Why j 1b (not just j 1)?<br>
1 = Label number → 1:<br>          
b = backward → Go to the last 1: label before this line.<br>

If you wrote j 1 only:<br>
→ That only works in local assembly inside .L1 labels auto-generated by compiler.<br>
But in inline asm:<br>
We can't guarantee 1: is globally unique.<br>
So 1b = Backward to 1:<br>
1f = Forward to 1:<br>
